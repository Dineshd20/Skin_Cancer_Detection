# Skin_Cancer_Detection with AI


## 📌 Overview  
This project explores the application of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** in the field of medicine, focusing on early detection of **skin cancer** through image classification. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and large verified datasets, the project provides an accessible and cost-efficient method for skin cancer screening, potentially saving lives and reducing healthcare costs.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- AI-powered **multi-class image classification** for skin cancer detection.  
- Trained on **Harvard Dataverse** dataset with verified medical images.  
- Supports prediction across **seven categories** (three cancer types and four non-cancer types).  
- Uses **Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV** for model development.  
- Web interface prototype for user-friendly interaction.  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries & Frameworks**:  
  - TensorFlow / Keras – Neural network training & CNN modeling  
  - OpenCV – Image preprocessing and live camera integration  
  - Matplotlib – Data visualization and analysis  
  - Splitfolders – Dataset splitting for training/testing  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda IDE)  

---

## 📊 Dataset  
- **Harvard Dataverse**: Large verified dataset with **seven different categories** of skin lesions, including both cancerous and non-cancerous classes.  
- Dataset verified by professionals, making it reliable for medical AI research.  

---

## 🧠 AI Model  
- **Multi-class CNN model** trained on the Harvard Dataverse dataset.  
- Different CNN architectures and data augmentation techniques were tested to improve accuracy.  
- Provides predictions with feedback on the type of lesion detected.  

---

## 💡 Motivation & Impact  
- **Medical impact**: Early detection can improve melanoma survival rates (from 66% to 99% when caught early).  
- **Social impact**: Provides affordable screening options for rural areas and patients without easy access to dermatologists.  
- **Economic impact**: Reduces healthcare costs by minimizing unnecessary office visits and streamlining screenings.  

---

## 📈 Future Work  
- Improve model accuracy with **augmented datasets**.  
- Add **symptom-based algorithms** (e.g., Random Forests) to enhance predictions.  
- Convert trained model to **JSON/TensorFlow.js** for integration into web/mobile apps.  
- Build a full-featured **website** with:  
  - Educational resources on skin cancer symptoms.  
  - AI-powered prediction model.  
  - Doctor-in-the-loop verification system.
